C-Sharp Cryptopia Manager 0.2b Change Log
==============================

Bug Fixes :
	- Selecting an order past the first item on buy and sell orders will now populate the form with a tally of all orders up to the one selected.
	- Market History has had duplicate data removed when Private Users loaded their Trade History
	- Refresh wallets on instant trade.
	- Buy and Sell buttons were being enabled prematurely.  API Class and API were always locked against this but now the GUI is locked too.
	- Fee calculation was extreme, however API still shows 20% on all currencies. (I'd always rather quote the fees high and have you pay less than expected)
	- Fix Open order from problems with zero open orders.

New Features :
	- Each Private User form has a refresh feature to update the data.
	- Each Private User form has sortable list columns.
